# Weather App!

[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Weather App Project. A simple app that allows users to get current weather data for a city using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

## Usage

Type a city name into the search input and submit. If the city is found the current weather data will be displayed. If the city is not found the app will return 'Invalid City'. You may have to be specific with your input, being careful to use the correct punctuation, e.g. 'Southend on Sea' retuns 'Invalid City' but 'Southend-on-Sea' is valid.
